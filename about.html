<h1> THEIR IS NOTHING WHAT DO YOU EXPECT I WLL DO EVERYTHING THIS IS NOT GOOD BUT I WILL GIVE U SOME JOKES AND I AM NOT JOKING.</h1>
<p>" Mother-in-law jokes
    Men often tell these jokes, and they’re also considered a little sexist and old-fashioned. Here’s an example:
    
    “My mother-in-law fell down a wishing well. I was amazed – I never knew they worked.”
    
    Explanation: A wishing well is a well (place where you can lower a bucket to bring up water) where you can make a wish – and it happens."</p>
    <p2>" Doctor jokes
        A “doctor” joke is a joke based on an imaginary situation when a patient explains a problem to the doctor. Here’s an example:
        
        Patient: Doctor, I have a pain in my eye whenever I drink tea.
        Doctor: Take the spoon out of the mug before you drink."</p2>
